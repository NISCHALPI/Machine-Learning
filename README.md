# Repository Name: Machine Learning and Data Science Projects

Welcome to the **Machine Learning and Data Science Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of diverse projects covering topics such as supervised learning, natural language processing (NLP), and internet churn analysis. Each project folder is organized with relevant code files, trained models, and datasets, providing valuable resources for learning and exploring these domains.

## Project Descriptions

### InternetChurnProject

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the internet service industry. It contains the following files:

- `final_model`: The final trained model for predicting customer churn.
- `job.err` and `job.out`: Error and output logs from the job execution.
- `learners`: Directory containing trained models for different classifiers, including Gradient Boosting Classifier (`gbc.joblib`), k-Nearest Neighbors (`knn.joblib`), Random Forest Classifier (`rf.joblib`), and Support Vector Classifier (`svc.joblib`).
- `slurm.script`: A script used for job execution in a SLURM environment.
- `supervised.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the supervised learning project.
- `supervised.py`: Python script with the code for the supervised learning project.
- `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`: Dataset file containing customer data for the churn analysis.

### NaturalLanguageProcessing

This project focuses on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It includes the following files:

- `learners`: Directory containing trained models for NLP tasks, such as k-Nearest Neighbors (`knn.joblib`), Logistic Regression (`log.joblib`), Meta-Learner Deployment (`meta_learner_deploy.joblib`), Naive Bayes (`nb.joblib`), Random Forest Classifier (`rf.joblib`), and Support Vector Machine (`svm.joblib`).
- `nlp_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the NLP project.
